# HRMS-SCD Dataset
Multi-scene, full-coverage high-resolution satellite remote sensing image semantic change detection dataset.

## Characteristics of the HRMS-SCD
This dataset is based on high-resolution satellite remote sensing images, delivering clearer and more detailed surface information compared to aerial images or low- and medium-resolution satellite images. This level of detail enables models to learn finer surface features, which enhances the performance of deep learning-based detection.

### Key Features
- **High-Resolution Detail**: Enables deep learning models to capture fine surface features, improving detection accuracy.
- **Diverse Semantic Labels**: Contains labels for seven common features (e.g., planted land, forest cover, buildings) that address class imbalance and improve generalization during training.
- **Wide Environmental Coverage**: Covers varied environments such as mountains, forests, croplands, and rivers, providing robustness across complex scenarios.
- **Two Image Sizes**: Available in 512×512 pixels for efficient training and 2048×2048 pixels to preserve global context.
